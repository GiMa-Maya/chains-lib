# Chainslib

This TypeScript library is designed to provide a unified interface for working with multiple blockchain networks, allowing developers to interact with various blockchain chains seamlessly. It supports a wide range of features and blockchain networks, making it a versatile tool for blockchain development.

## Features
This library offers the following key features:

Hardware Wallet Support: It provides integration with Ledger and Trezor hardware wallets for enhanced security in blockchain transactions.

Wallet Types: You can work with both seed phrase and private key wallets for managing your blockchain assets.

Standardized RPC Interface: The library offers a consistent RPC interface for fetching blockchain information and broadcasting transactions across different supported chains.

## Supported Chains
This library currently supports the following blockchain networks:
- Bitcoin
- Bitcoin Cash
- Litecoin
- Dogecoin
- EVM-Compatible Chains: Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain (BSC), Polygon, etc.
- Cosmos and IBC-Compatible Chains: Juno, Osmosis, etc.
- THORChain
- BNB Beacon Chain
- Solana

## Installation
To use this library in your TypeScript project, you can install it via npm or yarn:

```bash
npm install @xdefi-tech/chains
# or
yarn add @xdefi-tech/chains
```
## Usage
Here's a basic example of how to use this library in your TypeScript application:

### 1. Import Required Modules

```typescript
import { BitcoinProvider } from './chain.provider';
import LedgerSigner from './ledger.signer';
import { MsgBody, Msg } from '../msg';
```

### 2. Initialize Bitcoin Provider

Initialize the Bitcoin provider with the necessary configurations:

```typescript
const provider = new BitcoinProvider(new IndexerDataSource(BITCOIN_MANIFEST));
```

### 3. Create Transaction Input

Define the transaction input data, including the sender (from), recipient (to), and the amount to send.

```typescript
const txInput: MsgBody = {
  from: 'FROM ADDRESS',
  to: 'TO ADDRESS',
  amount: 0.000001,
};
```

### 4. Create a Transaction Message

Create a transaction message using the provider:

```typescript
const message: Msg = provider.createMsg(txInput);
```

### 5. Sign the Transaction with Ledger

Use the LedgerSigner to sign the transaction. Provide the message and the derivation path:

```typescript
const signer = new LedgerSigner();
const derivationPath = "m/84'/0'/0'/0/0";

await signer.sign(message, derivationPath);
```

### 6. Broadcast the Transaction

Now that the transaction is signed, you can broadcast it to the Bitcoin network using the BitcoinProvider. This step assumes that the transaction is already signed within the `message`.

```typescript
await provider.broadcast([message]);
```

## Retrieving a Transaction

### 1. Get Transaction Hash

If you have a transaction hash, you can retrieve the transaction details. Use the `getTransaction` method of the BitcoinProvider:

```typescript
const txHash = 'TX HAS';
const txData = await provider.getTransaction(txHash);
```

The `txData` object will contain transaction details, including the transaction hash.
